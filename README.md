# Statgl-shortcodes Extension For Quarto

A Quarto extension that provides custom shortcodes for displaying
structured statistics from Statistics Greenland. The shortcodes make it
easier to render KPI cards, highlight boxes, and other elements commonly
used for public-facing statistical content.

## Installing

``` bash
quarto add StatisticsGreenland/statgl-shortcodes
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions` subdirectory. If
you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.

## Using

To use the extension, include it in your Quarto projectâ€™s _quarto.yml:

``` bash
project:
  type: website

contributes:
  shortcodes:
    - statgl-shortcodes
```

You can then use the provided shortcodes in your .qmd files.
